                      <p align="justify"> SCAR is a framework to transparently execute containers out of Docker images in AWS Lambda, in order to run applications (see examples for ImageMagick, FFmpeg and AWS CLI, as well as deep learning frameworks such as Theano and Darknet) and code in virtually any programming language (see examples for Erlang and Elixir) on AWS Lambda.
                          SCAR provides the benefits of AWS Lambda with the execution environment you decide, provided as a Docker image available in Docker Hub. It is probably the easiest, most convenient approach to run generic applications on AWS Lambda, as well as code in your favourite programming language, not only in those languages supported by AWS Lambda.
                          SCAR also supports a High Throughput Computing Programming Model to create highly-parallel event-driven file-processing serverless applications that execute on customized runtime environments provided by Docker containers run on AWS Lambda.

                    <h3> Approach </h3>
                    <p align="justify"> SCAR provides a command-line interface to create a Lambda function to execute a container out of a Docker image stored in Docker Hub. Each invocation of the Lambda function will result in the execution of such a container (optionally executing a shell-script inside the container for further versatility).
                        The following underlying technologies are employed:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>udocker: A tool to execute Docker containers in user space. </li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>The Fakechroot execution mode of udocker is employed, since Docker containers cannot be natively run on AWS Lambda. Isolation is provided by the boundary of the Lambda function itself.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> AWS Lambda: A serverless compute service that runs Lambda functions in response to events. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p align="justify"> SCAR can optionally define a trigger so that the Lambda function is executed whenever a file is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. This file is automatically made available to the underlying Docker container run on AWS Lambda so that an user-provided shell-script can process the file. See the Programming Model for more details.</p>
                    <h3> Architecture </h3>
                    <p> A brief description of the SCAR architecture would be here. Moreover we can add a figure. But I'll wait till the paper has been published.
                    </p>
                    <h3> Limitations </h3>
                    <p> The limitations of SCAR are the current limitations of the serverless service, i.e. AWS Lambda. The most important are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Docker container must fit within the current AWS Lambda limits:  </li>
                        <ul>
                           <li> Compressed + uncompressed Docker image under 512 MB (udocker needs to download the image before uncompressing it).</li>
                           <li> Maximum execution time of 300 seconds (5 minutes).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> The following Docker images cannot be currently used:  </li>
                        <ul>
                           <li> Those based on Alpine Linux (due to the use of MUSL instead of GLIBC, which is not supported by Fakechroot).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li> Installation of packages in the user-defined script (i.e. using yum, apt-get, etc.) is currently not possible.</li>
                    </ul>
