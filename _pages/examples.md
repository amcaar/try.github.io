# Usage Examples of SCAR

This directory includes different use cases of applications packaged as Docker images that can be easily executed on AWS Lambda using SCAR:

* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), to execute shell-scripts using this tool.
* [Cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) and [Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)), just for silly testing.
* [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), to proof that you can run code in programming languages other than those supported by AWS Lambda. 
* [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), to proof that you can run code in programming languages other than those supported by AWS Lambda. 
* [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), a tool to transcode and manipulate videos.
* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org), a tool to manipulate images.
* [MrBayes](http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/), a scientific application for bayesian inference of Phylogeny.
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently.
* [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet) is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. For the example we will be using the library 'You only look once' [Yolo](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) which is  is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system
